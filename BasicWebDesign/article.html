      On Jan 31st, 2024, at 10:35 AM, Mark Testaberger, age 34, drove his car through the wall of a local convenience store in Ridgefield, Washington.<br>
      No fatalities, but three people, including the owner of the store, as well as his two son working in the store, were heavily injured, but are expected to make a full recovery.<br><br>
